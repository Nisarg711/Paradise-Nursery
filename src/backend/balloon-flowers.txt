Balloon flowers are clump-forming perennials and members of the easy-to-grow bellflower family of plants although the blooms do not resemble bells. Instead, puffy, balloon-like buds swell up to produce the 2- to 3-inch star-shaped blue-violet flowers. Balloon flowers will thrive in just about any condition, except in especially hot environments. This plant prefers rich soil, full sun, and temperatures between 60 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.
