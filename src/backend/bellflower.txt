The bellflower (Campanula bononiensis) is a truly amazing species. Its bold, bright blue flowers really stand out in the garden, and its airy foliage is a beautiful backdrop of color. It thrives in both sunny and shady locations, and is a reliable rebloomer throughout the summer. Plus, the bellflower is a great choice for container gardening too! The bellflower is also highly resistant to diseases, pests, and drought, making it an easy-care option for busy gardeners. With its dazzling display of bell-shaped blooms and ease of care, it's no wonder the bellflower is one of the most popular perennial plants.
