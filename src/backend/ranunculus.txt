Ranunculus flowers are beloved by florists and gardeners for bouquets and cut flower arrangements. These long-blooming perennials come in colors like yellow, pink, orange, red, purple, and white. Symbolizing charm, attraction, and the early stages of romance, ranunculus are known for their multilayered petals that appear similar to roses.

Ranunculus are typically early-spring blooms, but can flower through early summer, and stay flowering anywhere from four to seven weeks. The various species in this genus require similar care—plenty of sunlight, well-draining soil, and warm weather—to reach maturity. Mature ranunculus can stretch from two inches tall to two feet tall. It's important to know that most species in the Ranunculus genus are toxic to people and pets.
